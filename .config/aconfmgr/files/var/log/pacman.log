[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] of the two available options (In alphabetical, not recommended, order):
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 1. polkit: This will make sway "just work" right after installation but may be
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET]            a weightier solution than desired.
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 2. seatd: Already required as a sway dependency, this is a lighter-weight
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET]           solution but requires some user configuration: Enabling the service,
[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET]           adding your user to the "seat" group, then logging out/in again.

[2023-01-26T04:05:49+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] Either option should provide the same functionality/stability. Refer to the
